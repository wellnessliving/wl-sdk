  /**
   * Transaction was refunded fully and purchase has been cancelled.
   *
   * Void is a type of refund with set of limits. The main difference between refund and void is, that during refund we
   * can cancel transaction before it was settled or we can return money that we have already got. During void of the
   * transaction we cannot return money, we can only cancel transaction if it has not been settled yet.
   *
   * This is important because returning of the money is connected to the bank commissions and cancelling the
   * transaction is a free option. That's why this is two different ways to cancel purchase.
   *
   * The voided transaction is a transaction that never exists. This also means that purchase that is connected to the
   * voided transaction should be always erased.
   *
   * Voiding transaction has sets of limits:<ul>
   *   <li>transaction should not be settled;</li>
   *   <li>transaction should not be from internal account balance;</li>
   *   <li>transaction should be single in the purchase.</li>
